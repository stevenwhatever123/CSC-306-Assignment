# MyApplication
 This is my CSC-306 Writing Mobile Apps Assignment  
  
The following video is what I submitted to the university to demonstrate my app.

In this assignment, I designed and implemented an Android news app.  
The app allows users to have an account they can enter key terms that they are interested in using newsapi Kotlin.  
The app will display key information such as news publisher, article title, article image and summary text.  
It also sets up alerts that can be pushed to a user when stories they are interested in are available.  

In the implementation, it is targeted to run Android API level 27 or above.  
An extra implementation I have done is adding a text to speech feature, where the app would read out the text in the news. It wil still works if the app is running in the background.  

I scored 78% in this assignment and find it interesting throughout the whole implementation process even though I async problems are hard to debug and solve.  

The database system I used for storing user account details and news preferences is Firebase, a platform developed by Google.  
However, if you tried to run my build, it should not work since my Firebase trial has ended.
